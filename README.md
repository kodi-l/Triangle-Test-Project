# Triangle-Test-Project
University of Minnesota Project

This project includes a basic JUnit test for the `Demo.java` class, which checks whether three sides can form a triangle. Itâ€™s part of my software testing learning journey and shows my ability to write unit tests using JUnit.

## Objective

Create effective unit tests using JUnit in `DemoTest.java` to validate the logic in `Demo.java`, especially around edge cases and boundary conditions.

## Files
- `Demo.java`: Main Java file containing triangle-checking logic.
- `DemoTest.java`: Test file (in progress) using JUnit framework.

## Technologies
- Java 8+
- JUnit 4/5 (for testing)

## Coming Soon
- Test cases for valid and invalid triangles
- Mutation analysis walkthrough
