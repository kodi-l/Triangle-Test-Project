# Triangle-Test-Project
University of Minnesota Project

This project contains a Java program (`Demo.java`) that checks whether three given sides form a valid triangle using simple logic.

## Objective

Create effective unit tests using JUnit in `DemoTest.java` to validate the logic in `Demo.java`, especially around edge cases and boundary conditions.

## Files
- `Demo.java`: Main Java file containing triangle-checking logic.
- `DemoTest.java`: Test file (in progress) using JUnit framework.

## Technologies
- Java 8+
- JUnit 4/5 (for testing)

## Coming Soon
- Test cases for valid and invalid triangles
- Mutation analysis walkthrough
